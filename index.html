                <h5>P2: Baseball Career Arc</h5>
                <p>
                    The project is motivated by PECOTA, a sophisticated method of forecasting player output for the upcoming season by Nate Silver in 2003. This study looks at batter performance trends as a function of player age. Batter performance is determined by On-Base-Percentage, or OBP, a popular metric in measuring batter value. <br>
                    The result is a performance curve that increases and peaks at age 27 and decreases from there on. The curve has the appearance of an arc due to a decrease in performance velocity over time that is the consequence of negative performance acceleration.

                <h5>P3: Data Wrangling of Singapore Map Data</h5>
                <p>
                    According to Wikipedia, every building in Singapore is given its unique postcode. Any piece of imperfect address information that can be linked to its actual postcode has the potential to have perfect address information. An online database consisting of 124,285 unique postcodes with complete address information was parsed. The quest for perfect addresses begin.
