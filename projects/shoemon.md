As a volunteer staff for Jordan Flight School in Santa Barbara, 2016, I was astounded by the zeal behind the Air Jordan brand and the enormity of its secondary market. Everyone from coaches to the kids were buying and selling shoes at hundreds of dollars, and it was not clear who knew what a fair price was. This inspired me to create Shoemon.
